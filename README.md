# 🎓 Predicting Job Placement Outcomes Using Logistic Regression

This project involves building a machine learning model to **predict job placement outcomes** based on students' academic performance, test scores, and work experience. The model helps in understanding which features contribute most significantly to job placement success.

---

## 📌 Objective

To develop a logistic regression-based predictive model that determines the likelihood of a student getting placed, based on historical data such as:
- Academic grades
- Aptitude test scores
- Work experience
- Stream of study and other relevant features

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- End-to-end **machine learning pipeline**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data distribution
- **Feature engineering** to transform and select relevant predictors
- Built using **Logistic Regression** (baseline model)
- Evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualizing relationships between features and placement outcome

3. **Model Building**
   - Train/test split
   - Logistic Regression training
   - Hyperparameter tuning

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Classification metrics
   - Confusion matrix and ROC curve

---

## 📊 Results

- Achieved ~XX% accuracy (replace with actual)
- Top predictive features: `ssc_p`, `hsc_p`, `degree_p`, `etest_p`, `workex`, etc.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Try ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Integrate into a **Streamlit web app**
- Collect more features (e.g., internships, projects)
